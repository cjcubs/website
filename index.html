		<p>Hey there, if you're reading this it's because i gave you this link. A few years back i realised that actively using and having social media was driving me insane. So i deactivated them. i went from constantly feeling watched and observed to being—often happily—out of the loop. When i'm thinking of someone now i often just reach out to them and ask. It feels nice and i intend to keep doing it.</p>
        <p>i don't really plan on posting regularly here. Or even really calling what i'm doing here "posting" per se. The idea of doing anything to post still feels fraught to me, but i do want to live in a world where people share without expectations or feedback. So maybe that is still posting and i'm just being angsty. Who knows. We've long since left my original point behind.</p>

	<p>Outside my ramblings i'd like to thank you for showing the care and follow through to actually visit something i've worked on. i can never thank you enough.</p>
