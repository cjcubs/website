		<p>Hey there, if you're reading this it's because you followed my hard link. A few years back I realised that actively using and having social media was driving me insane. So I deactivated them. I went from constantly feeling watched and observed to being—often happily—out of the loop. When I'm thinking of someone now I often just reach out to them and ask. It feels nice and I intend to keep doing it.</p>
        <p>I don't really plan on posting regularly here. Or even really calling what I'm doing here "posting" per se. The idea of doing anything explicitly to post still feels a bit fraught to me, but I do want to live in a world where people share without expectations or feedback. So maybe that is still posting and I'm just being angsty. Who knows. We've long since left my original point behind.</p>

	<p>Outside my ramblings I'd like to thank you for showing the care and follow-through to actually visit something I've worked on. I can never thank you enough.</p>
