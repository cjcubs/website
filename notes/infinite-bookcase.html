        <h4> infinite bookcase </h4>
		<p> I've been doodling/drafting a fractual-ly modular bookcase based off a visual pun from more than a year ago as I write this. One day I still want to make that bookcase, but since that initial idea my library has grown too fast (not counting all the boxes I have back homeâ€”sorry Mom).</p>
		<p>That's where this one came in. It's cheap by furniture standards and is able to consistently grow and change to suit my literary and spatial needs. Also it makes me look rugged.</p>

		<p>Outside my ramblings I'd like to thank you for showing the care and follow through to actually visit something I've worked on. I can never thank you enough.</p>
